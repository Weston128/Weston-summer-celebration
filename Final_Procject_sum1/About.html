     <p class="tiny_text">My name is Weston Haveman and I'm 14 years old going into my first year of 
        highschool. My journey so far has been marked by a relentless pursuit of growth, particularly in 
        academics where I've already skipped a math grade and am now heading into Honors Algebra 2. This 
        dedication to learning also secured my acceptance into The Hidden Genius Project, a summer program 
        that promises exciting new challenges. Beyond the classroom, I'm a passionate soccer player with a 
        lifelong love for the game, having celebrated a significant victory in a challenging tournament with 
        my team. My quick thinking extends to Rubik's Cubes, where my unofficial personal best is a 
        lightning-fast 12 seconds, with an official competition time of 22 seconds. When I'm not on the field 
        or solving puzzles, you can often find me expanding my collection of sneakers; I currently own five 
        pairs of Jordans.</p>
