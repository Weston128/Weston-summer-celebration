     <h1 class="title_text2">My Achievements</h1>
     <div class="random_div"></div>
     <h1 class="header_text2">Getting into double advanced math</h1>
     <p class="tiny_text">From an early age, mathematics has been a source of fascination for me. 
        This natural curiosity ignited a strong desire to master complex concepts and excel in the subject.
         In fifth grade, I encountered a significant academic hurdle: a demanding placement test for advanced 
         math. Rather than being discouraged, I dedicated extensive hours to preparation, thoroughly immersing
          myself in every concept. My diligent efforts yielded remarkable results when I, along with only one
           other student out of more than twenty, successfully passed the test. This early accomplishment
            fueled an ongoing commitment to academic growth, ultimately allowing me to skip a grade in
             mathematics. As I enter ninth grade, I am prepared to embrace the challenges of Honors Algebra 2,
              eager to continue expanding my understanding and capabilities in the field.</p>
              <h1 class="header_text2">Winning a soccer tournament</h1>
              <p class="tiny_text">From a young age, soccer has been more than just a game; it's been a 
                lifelong passion. My journey began with a team that faced its share of early struggles and 
                frequent losses. However, through dedication and persistent effort, we steadily improved, 
                gradually transforming into a formidable force that began to consistently win tournaments and 
                divisions. This particular achievement stands out because we competed in an exceptionally 
                challenging league and division. Despite the high level of competition, our team persevered 
                and ultimately emerged victorious, a testament to our collective growth and unwavering 
                determination.</p>
              <h1 class="header_text2">Getting admitted into the Hidden Genius Project</h1>
              <p class="tiny_text">When the staff from The Hidden Genius Project first visited my school, 
                their presentation immediately sparked a deep sense of excitement and ambition within me. 
                I was captivated by the program's mission and knew instantly that I wanted to be a part of it.
                 Preparing for the interview, I dedicated hours to research, watching every available YouTube 
                 video to absorb as much information as possible. My diligent preparation paid off, and the 
                 confirmation arrived via email: I had been accepted. This acceptance marked a pivotal moment,
                  validating my efforts and opening the door to an incredible summer of growth and learning.</p>
